\section{Intersection Curves}
Intersection curves are tied to two objects where at
least one is a surface or a curve.
The representation of the intersection curves in the SISLIntcurve structure has two levels.
The first level is guide points which are
points in the parametric space and on the intersection
curve. In every case
there must be at least one guide point, but there is no
upper bound. This will be the result from the topology routines.
The second level is curves,
one curve in the geometric space and one curve in each
parameter plane if each surface is parametric. This will be the result from the marching routines.

\subsection{Intersection curve object.}

In the library an intersection curve is stored in a struct SISLIntcurve
containing the following:
\input{type/SISLIntcurve}
Singularities are points on the intersection curve where, in an intersection between a curve and a surface, the tangent
of the curve lies in the tangent plane of the surface, or in an intersection between two surfaces, the tangent plane
of the surfaces coincide.
